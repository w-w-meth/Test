# Step 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /src

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) for installing dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the React app using Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output to Nginx's default HTML directory
COPY --from=build /src/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port that Nginx will use
EXPOSE 80

# Run Nginx in the foreground (default command in nginx:alpine)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
